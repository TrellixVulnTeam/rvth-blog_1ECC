&lt;p&gt;Inspired by @codechips' SQL Squid Game guide, I thought it would be fun to use some Squid Game data to write a guide on the basics of the Pandas library in Python including creating a DataFrame, modifying rows and columns and inspecting the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Importing Pandas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why I track my learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started tracking my learning last year after reading &lt;a href="https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Sky Houdei. I've found it a really great way to keep a track the things I am learning and to help motivate me to keep trying new things.

&lt;h2&gt;What Is Python?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Python is an open-source, object-oriented interactive programming language that is interpreted line by line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With simple and easy to learn syntax, as well as advanced readability and support for a number of modules and libraries, Python is well-loved due to the increased productivity it provides …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ruth</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:rvth.blog,2021-03-17:/journal/python-for-seo.html</guid><category>misc</category><category>SEO</category><category>Python</category></item><item><title>My experience with Code First Girls</title><link>https://rvth.blog/journal/code-first-girls.html</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;My first experience with Code First Girls was in February 2020. I still can't believe I walked into a room in Goldman Sachs in Holborn full of strangers, to start learning to code. The course was the Introduction to Python Programming class, and while I had a base knowledge of …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ruth</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:rvth.blog,2021-02-11:/journal/code-first-girls.html</guid><category>misc</category><category>Coding</category><category>Inspiration</category><category>Personal</category></item><item><title>I built a website about Dogs and SEO</title><link>https://rvth.blog/journal/seo-dogs.html</link><description>
&lt;h2&gt;What is SEO dogs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, SEO dogs is a website I built to share knowledge around the fundamentals of SEO in a fun format that is super accessible for anyone, regardless of their experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each page, or element of SEO, contains a picture of an adoptable dog (I tried …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ruth</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:rvth.blog,2021-01-14:/journal/seo-dogs.html</guid><category>misc</category><category>Dogs</category><category>SEO</category></item><item><title>Reasons to Not Get a Dog</title><link>https://rvth.blog/journal/reasons-to-not-get-a-dog.html</link><description>
&lt;p&gt;There's no question about how amazing and enriching owning a dog can be.  But it also a huge commitment and with the wonderful things, also comes the less pleasant factors which everyone should be aware of if they are thinking of getting a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I &lt;a href="https://rvth.blog/article/python-and-google-trends.html"&gt;shared some of the things&lt;/a&gt; I had learned while playing around with the Google Trends Python library, PyTrends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why did you start learning to code?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question makes me panic a bit, because to be honest, I don’t really think I have a sufficient answer. “I don’t know, I just wanted to learn something new” is what I would typically answer.
