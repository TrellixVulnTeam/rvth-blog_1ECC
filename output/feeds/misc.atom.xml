&lt;p&gt;Inspired by @codechips' SQL Squid Game guide, I thought it would be fun to use some Squid Game data to write a guide on the basics of the Pandas library in Python including creating a DataFrame, modifying rows and columns and inspecting the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Importing Pandas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635697226433/p1kLqNC4g.gif" alt="Squid Game" class="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by @codechips' SQL Squid Game guide, I thought it would be fun to use some Squid Game data to write a guide on the basics of the Pandas library in Python including creating a DataFrame, modifying rows and columns and inspecting the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Importing Pandas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to import that Pandas library and alias it as pd. This means we don't have to call the full word when we run a Pandas function, we just need to type pd.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
import pandas as pd&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main data structure of Pandas is a DataFrame, which is similar to an excel spreadsheet, where we can store data. Once the data is within a DataFrame, there are several ways it can be used, for example data analysis or to visualise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introducing DataFrames&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataFrames store data in rows and columns. Each column has a name, which is a string, and each row has an index, which is typically an integer. Like lists in Python, DataFrames also use 0 indexing, which means the first row in index 0 instead of index 1. However, you can set the index to include extra information about what the row contains if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635684575976/YYzdNTC9B.png" alt="DataFrame"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataFrames can contain many different data types, including strings, integers and floats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a DataFrame by uploading data from a csv file, but you can also create a DataFrame by typing values into a list and using a dictionary to transform it into a DataFrame. You can use multiple different lists, containing different data types, but the value of content included in each must be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
data = {'Name':  ['Oh Il-Nam', 'Kang Sae-byeok', 'Jang Deok-su', 'Abdul Ali', 'Han Mi-nyeo',  'Cho Sang-woo', 'Ji-yeong'],

'Number': [1, 67, 101, 199, 212, 218, 240],
        }

df = pd.DataFrame(data, index = ["player1", "player67", "player101", "player199", "player212", "player281",

"player240"])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see above we have one list with the players names, typed as strings, and another with their number, which is an integer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then transform this dictionary of lists to a DataFrame using the pd.DataFrame() command. We also set the index values, by passing the string names as a list argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inspecting a DataFrame&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the data has been added, we want to make sure it looks correct and contains everything we want. The best method to do this is to use df.head(). This will show the first 5 rows of data. However, if you would like to see more data, i.e 10 rows, you can pass this as an argument within the brackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
df.head(10)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635684192998/BSI6OefFT.png" alt="Our Created DataFrame"&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we want to only view the data from one row, we can use the panda-specific access method .loc. This is a label based method, meaning we have to specify the name of the row we want to view, this method can only use string. Here we add in the index name that we specified when creating the DataFrame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
print(df.loc["player67"])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635684208937/PwpNHm1re.png" alt="Row"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other access method is .iloc, which is integer based, by specifying the positional index of the row we want to view. We would use this one if we hadn't changed the index, or if we had changed it to another integer value instead of a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635690271373/FkLwSbFId.png" alt="Column"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also get a count of how many rows within the DataFrame, by using the count() function. This will print the number of rows in each column.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
df.count()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635684222534/zlvMgpnzK.png" alt="Count"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we only want to print a single number to display the row count, we can pass in the name of the column we want to square within square brackets before the count function. Storing this within a variable will also enable us to use this number for functions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
player_count = df['Name'].count()

player_count&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding a new row&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of different ways to add new rows to a DataFrame. If we have multiple rows within another DataFrame, we can use the .append() function to add several rows to the end of our existing DataFrame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we have just 1 row to add, i.e only 1 new player to add, we can again use the .loc method to add the row to the end of our original DataFrame. As we are defining the name of our indexes, we need to pass this in before the new values that will be within the row. The number of values contained must match the number of columns we have and be in the correct order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
df.loc['player456'] = ['Seong Gi-hun', 456]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if we print the head() of the new DataFrame, we will see our new row added in üßë‚Äçü¶∞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635684246183/_tnVDlj_u.png" alt="Added Row"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding a new column&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to adding a new row, we can also add a new column. There are several ways you can define the value that will be contained within this column for each row, including based on what is within other columns and using conditional statement or lambda function. However, in this case we want the value to be the same for every row, to show that every player is currently playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this we just need to add the name of our new column and assign it the value that we want to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
df['Status'] = "Playing"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635684288720/Hps6Ba-7n.png" alt="Added Column"&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Changing values&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a column with the status of all players that are playing the game. But what happens when we start to have eliminations? We need to update the value in that column üò¨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we will use the .loc method to define the row that we will be amending and the column that we will be changing the value of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case it will be based on their number, so we need to pass in this column name and use the equals to ensure it is only going to change the single row that equals that row in the Number column. Next we will pass in the name of the column that we will be amending before assigning the new value of Eliminated üò¢&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
df.loc[df.Number == 1, "Status"] = "Eliminated"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635684316867/WkohnycJf.png" alt="Amended Column"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Deleting a row&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once players start being eliminated, they will be removed from the game, therefore we will want to ensure we have updated DataFrame that reflects this and only contains those who are currently playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we want to keep track of all of the players in the original DataFrame, we don't want to delete anything from this one. However, we can use the data from our original DataFrame to make another one while leaving the original untouched. We can do this by defining the name of our new DataFrame and apply some logic to pull data from our original one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, .drop() allows us to drop (aka delete, but I guess in the instance of game 5, literally drop) the eliminated players. As we have changed their status to Eliminated, we can use this value to delete them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
round5 = df.drop(df.index[df['Status'] == "Eliminated"])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to drop the rows based on their name or number, but this would be done on a row by row basis, rather than removing multiple at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can view the new DataFrame, and see our remaining players for the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
round5.head()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635684404025/o_-4tbSEq.png" alt="New DataFrame"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using the data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing we can do is use the count function mentioned earlier, where we extracted a count value for the columns based on conditional statements. For example, if we want to print the number of players who have a status of Playing, and then for those who have status of Eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
eliminated = df[df['Status'] == "Eliminated"]['Name'].count()

playing = df[df['Status'] == "Playing"]['Name'].count()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Assigning these values to a variable means we can also use these counts to create simple sentences using f strings. As the variable values are mutable, we can update these after every game when players are eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
print(f"there are currently {playing} players playing")

print(f"there are currently {eliminated} players eliminated")&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635684418784/mo-Mb5B_3.png" alt="Sentences"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not to forget a wonderful maths function, we can use the number of eliminated players and take this from the total number of players who started to get a count for the current players in the game.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;code class="‚Äùlanguage-python‚Äù"&gt;
total_players = 8

current = total_players - eliminated&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this has been a helpful (and fun) way to understand the basics of the Pandas library in Python. I'm  also hoping to make more posts that go further in detail covering logical statements, merging and visualisations in Pandas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why I track my learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why I track my learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started tracking my learning last year after reading &lt;a href="https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Sky Houdei. I've found it a really great way to keep a track the things I am learning and to help motivate me to keep trying new things. It also helps to keep me to accountable to things I have signed up for and make sure I follow through with what I have committed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What I track&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things I track in my learning log are any courses I take, tutorials I have followed, videos I have watched or educational books I have read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things that you can track in a learning log could be interesting articles or webinars and even events you may attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How I use my learning log&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several columns that I track in the learning log;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The title of the course or book&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The learning provider, creator or author&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The learning type (course, video, book etc)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The language or skill that I have learned&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The progress (starting soon, in progress or completed)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The date I completed it&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created my learning log in Notion, which makes it super easy to keep updated, is really customisable and also allows me to create a page linked to each course or book so I can keep note of any key finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notion also allows you to create several different views of the same information, so I can have a table view to display all of the information, as well as a kanban board view grouped by the progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/learning-log.webp" class="responsive" alt="Learning log"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also created a template of the learning log, which is free to duplicate and use if you would like to create your own learning log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the template &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/Learning-Log-Template-5b7e1bf9c80a4dc2a25f649f98c33350"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and all you need to do is select duplicate (and create a Notion account if you don't already have one). Then you're ready to start tracking your learning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Table view&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/ll-table-view.webp" class="responsive" alt="Learning log table"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table view features columns for the title, learning provider or author, type, language or skill, a space to track progress and for adding the date of completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some filter options already added for the learning type, language and progress sections, but these are completely customisable if you are tracking different things or learning different languages or skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/ll-filters.webp" class="responsive" alt="Learning log filters"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, each course can have it's own individual page where you can track any useful notes or findings. There is the option to either use the learning log notes template, which is a bullet list, or to keep the page empty and customise it how you would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/ll-page.webp" class="responsive" alt="Learning log page"&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/ll-notes.webp" class="responsive" alt="Learning log notes"&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Board views&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some board views within the template, which are grouped by the progress of each course, so you can keep a track of those in progress and easily add anything you are hoping to start soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/ll-board-.webp" class="responsive" alt="Learning log board"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this has been helpful if you're looking to track your learning. I'd love to hear if you use the template and any additions you would make :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Is Python?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Python is an open-source, object-oriented interactive programming language that is interpreted line by line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With simple and easy to learn syntax, as well as advanced readability and support for a number of modules and libraries, Python is well-loved due to the increased productivity it provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a testament to this, Python is used by some of the biggest organizations in the world to power their platforms, perform data analysis, and run their machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies including Google, YouTube, Netflix, NASA, Spotify, and IBM have publicly stated Python has been an important part of their growth, due to its simplicity, speed, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Google‚Äôs first web-crawler was actually written in Python and it remains one of their official server-side languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Run Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run Python scripts in a number of ways, depending on what works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most systems come with Python already installed, although it‚Äôs worth noting that this will more than likely be Python 2, which will be officially deprecated in 2020 now that Python 3 is deemed stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can run Python from your terminal or command line IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or use cloud-based alternatives including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jupyter Notebooks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Colab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These provide an easier experience for beginners to learn and test elements of code line by line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python Libraries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main power of Python is in its libraries, which enable a number of add-ons including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data extraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis and preparation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scientific computing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural language processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some useful libraries for tasks involving data analysis and automation include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;TensorFlow:&lt;/b&gt; An open-source machine learning library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;NumPy:&lt;/b&gt; Useful for scientific computing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SciPy:&lt;/b&gt; Used for scientific and technical computing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SciKit Learn:&lt;/b&gt; Machine learning for data mining and analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pandas:&lt;/b&gt; Used for data manipulation and analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpaCy:&lt;/b&gt; A great natural language processing library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Requests:&lt;/b&gt; A library for making HTTP requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Python Can Help with Technical SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While having an understanding of the languages which power the websites we work on (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is important, Python provides many automation opportunities for low-level tasks which we would usually spend several hours undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python empowers SEO professionals in a number of ways as it not only enables us to automate repetitive tasks, but also to extract and analyze large data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of data marketers work with is only increasing, so being able to efficiently analyze this will help to solve many complex problems in a shorter amount of time.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This in turn saves valuable time and allows us to be more efficient in undertaking other important SEO tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These factors combined have led to a growth in the popularity of Python amongst SEO professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to better understand data will not only help us do our jobs better, but will also allow us to make data-driven decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These decisions will then enable us to provide concrete insights for our clients and stakeholders and have more confidence in the recommendations we implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automating with Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Python will not be able to imitate human, emotion-led strategy, Python scripts can be used to automate a large number of time-consuming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list of tasks you can automate with Python is growing continuously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying user intent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mapping URLs ahead of a migration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal link analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performing keyword research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizing images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scraping websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal linking analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log file analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hreflang validation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyword growth calculation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collecting GSC data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performing competitor analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Powering Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is also a popular language used to power machine learning applications due to its simple, intuitive and accessible syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also open-source, with several developer advocates providing support for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are a large number of useful libraries which are helpful when working with and training machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Is Machine Learning?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is essentially ‚Äúan application of artificial intelligence that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience, without the need to be explicitly programmed‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is typically used to identify patterns in data, upon which predictions can then be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python &amp; Machine Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run in conjunction with machine learning, Python can be used to power scripts for training a dataset, before it summarizes and visualizes the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, the model will evaluate the algorithms to enable predictions to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Real-World Machine Learning Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of machine learning on the web is increasing all the time, with new models being created and training data becoming more accessible daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some real-world machine learning examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google‚Äôs RankBrain algorithm.
&lt;li&gt;Baidu‚Äôs Deep Voice program.
&lt;li&gt;Twitter‚Äôs curated timelines.
&lt;li&gt;Netflix and Spotify recommendations.
&lt;li&gt;Salesforce‚Äôs Einstein feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEO Possibilities with Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to their ability to solve complex problems, it is no surprise that machine learning models are being used to help make marketers‚Äô lives easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Britney Muller says:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúMachine Learning is becoming more accessible and will free us up to work on higher-level strategy.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will enable you to spend more time finding solutions, rather than just identifying problems. Some examples of machine learning models used in SEO include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content quality evaluation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying keyword gaps and opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaining insights into user engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizing title tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating meta description creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcribing audio.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google‚Äôs NLP Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such model worth checking out is Google‚Äôs Natural Language Processing API, which uses machine learning to reveal the structure and meaning of text. It analyzes text to understand the sentiment, as well as extract key information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does this API allow you to train a model personalized to your content, providing results that are relevant to your specific needs, you will also gain an insight into Google‚Äôs understanding of your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish, I wanted to share my three biggest tips for getting started and continuing to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tip 1: Talk to Your Developers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a high chance the developers you work with will have an understanding of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a conversation with them, let them know what you‚Äôre working on and spark their interest too ‚Äì there may even be something you can collaborate on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tip 2: Join Communities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about learning Python is the support available, there are so many online communities with hundreds of supportive individuals willing to provide non-judgmental advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tip 3: Keep Practicing &amp; Have Fun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most important piece of advice a developer friend gave to me. There is no pressure to become a Python master in weeks. Take your time to learn the language and start fun side projects to put what you are learning into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first experience with Code First Girls was in February 2020. I still can't believe I walked into a room in Goldman Sachs in Holborn full of strangers, to start learning to code. The course was the Introduction to Python Programming class, and while I had a base knowledge of Python from a Codeacademy course, it was a completely different ball game being in an in-person CFG class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Coronavirus ruined the in-person sessions (as it did most things), but the course moved online and because we had missed several sessions due to lockdown, I had the option to start again from scratch with some new instructors. I decided to do this as I thought it would be a good chance to refresh what I had already learnt and work with even more people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Code First Girls?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code First Girls (CFG) are an organisation with a really clear mission:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Code First Girls are dedicated to transforming tech by providing the skills, space and inspiration for women to become kick-ass developers and future leaders."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do this by running free coding courses to help people break into tech as well as cultivating a community of coders, trainers and coaches, facilitating women to break into and excel within the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be eligible you must be aged 18-23 OR have studied in the last two years OR be a student at a University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Materials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the courses, the CFG team will share the materials for each week which usually includes a set-up guide and the slides for each session. This is so useful for reference and to follow along each week. They also include optional homework tasks for furthering learning from each session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Python Programming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first course I took was the Introduction to Python Programming (obviously). This is a beginner-friendly course to help students learn the fundamentals of programming through problem-solving in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Software used&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Python Programming course we used PyCharm as the IDE. It was my first time using this software but the learning curve wasn't very steep and it's actually my go-to IDE for personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Course structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week focused on a different fundamental element of Python and the lessons built upon each other before ending with a final project. The course outline looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 1: Python Basics: Data Types and Variables&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 2: Problem Solving: Input, Loops and Functions with Turtle&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 3: Decision Making: Logic and If Statements&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 4: Lists and Dictionaries&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 5: Files, Pip and APIs&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 6: Building Your App: Project Planning and Projects&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 7: Building Your App: Project Work Time&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 8: Project Presentations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Group project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always found group projects difficult, I'm a bit of a control freak and really struggle when relying on other people to finish things. I think this was made even harder because we were doing it remotely, and unlike with work I didn't really know the girls that were in my group and our only communication was via slack sporadically throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we managed work together on our final project, which was to use some data shared to us in CSV files and extract useful information from them. We also had the opportunity to explore other data sets including ones on London Crime, and the Coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Final project/presentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final week involved us presenting our final project and sharing what we had been working on. This was a really great way to practice explaining the steps we undertook for each task, succulently talk about the findings and data we extracted and answer questions from our peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Web development - HTML and JS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the Python Programming course, I also decided to enrol on the Web Development course which focused on the fundamental skills of front-end web development. I was super interested in it as there was three dedicated sessions on JavaScript and the final project involved building a website from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Course outline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 8 week course was structured really well, with sessions dedicated to the basics of web development and a clear introduction to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 1: HTML basics&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 2: CSS basics&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 3: Recap &amp; Project Overview&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 4: JavaScript Part 1 (Overview, data types, loops and conditionals)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 5: JavaScript Part 2 (Functions and scope)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 6: JavaScript Part 3 (Objects and the DOM)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 7: Github 101 &amp; Frameworks&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Week 8: Project presentations &amp; Careers in Web Dev&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Final project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again the group project was pretty difficult and I actually ended up being put into a group with two others who had not finished their sign up and were not actually taking part in the course. I therefore decided to work by myself to build a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with the initial plan for the website and worked on a mock-up. We then spent time creating the HTML and CSS that was required to make our actual websites look like our wireframes, before adding some JavaScript to ensure the site had some interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the perfect way to finish the course as it rounded up everything we had learnt and allowed us to put everything into practice to really cement our learning. It was so fun that I actually decided to continue making the website I had initially created and it cumulated in &lt;a href="seo-dogs.co.uk"&gt;SEO Dogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up, I would definitely recommend the Code First Girls courses for any females or non-binary folks who are interested in learning to code and can commit to a couple of hours a week for 8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also super excited to become an instructor on the Python Programming course, where I get help other people get their start in learning to code, just like Code First Girls allowed me to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tips for anyone starting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;You don't need to have done any coding before&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is designed for beginners so you don't need to have had any past experience, promise - you just need to have the right attitude to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Install the required technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, the CFG team provide clear instructions for the set-up and what is required ahead of the first session. I would definitely recommend setting aside some time to get everything installed and set-up. This will ensure you can get started straight away, make sure you don't miss anything and will also help you to feel a little more comfortable with the tools you will be using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Take time to prepare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the CFG team will send you all of the learning materials before hand, together with a small guide for before you start. Take a bit of time to familiarise yourself with the materials ahead of the first session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Join the slack group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team will also share a link to the slack channel for the course. I would definitely recommend joining that as soon as possible as they will usually share some useful information ahead of the first session and will continue sharing resources throughout the whole course. There is also the opportunity to introduce yourself and meet the other participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chat to others on the course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially important for the remote courses, as when you are in a room together you naturally chat with those near you and share your solutions, but this isn't as easy when you are completing the course remotely. The slack channel is a great way to chat with your fellow participants, even if it might make you feel a little uncomfy at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Courses available&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The courses currently available are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Web Development&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Python Programming&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Data Science &amp; SQL Programming&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Get started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is SEO dogs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, SEO dogs is a website I built to share knowledge around the fundamentals of SEO in a fun format that is super accessible for anyone, regardless of their experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each page, or element of SEO, contains a picture of an adoptable dog (I tried ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">
&lt;h2&gt;What is SEO dogs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, SEO dogs is a website I built to share knowledge around the fundamentals of SEO in a fun format that is super accessible for anyone, regardless of their experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each page, or element of SEO, contains a picture of an adoptable dog (I tried to relate the dog to the topic either through their name, personality traits, or breed as best I could). The dogs are all from &lt;a href="https://wildatheartfoundation.org/"&gt;Wild at Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt; which is a global dog rescue &amp; adoption organisation - finding rescued dogs the forever homes they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why did you make it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good question :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty I made it just as a bit of fun. It was a weird 3am insomnia idea in lockdown and I thought it would be the perfect way to put into practice some of the skills I had been learning. I've always wanted to build a website so decided to just give it a go. I'm not a developer or designer, but I had a lot of fun seeing my initial wireframes come to life in the form of an actual fully functioning website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is sooo much information out there around the fundamentals of SEO, and it can be really intimidating, especially when you are first starting out learning SEO. I wanted to create an inclusive and accessible space for folks with any level of SEO understanding to feel more confident and comfortable with the key elements of SEO.  Basically combining my knowledge from working in SEO, and useful resources that I have consumed while learning (and dogs of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a massive dog lover, and rescue advocate so it made perfect sense to combine two things I am passionate about - helping people understand SEO, and dogs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How did you make it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main framework of the website is &lt;a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt;, which is a micro web framework written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I chose Flask was because I've been learning Python over the last year and thought it would be another great way to put into practice those skills I have been learning, in a slightly different way to the other projects I had been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's actually pretty simple to use and get to grips with, and I got familiar with it pretty quickly. I started by following a couple of tutorials and when I felt comfortable with the basics I jumped in and got started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Main Content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the pages are written in HTML with CSS classes throughout to style them, making them pretty simple to create and replicate, and of course edit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I have really written anything in CSS, so it was definitely a learning curve but once I got to grips with the syntax, properties and rules that could be added to each selector it was a lot of fun playing around with the style and seeing everything come together and look relatively similar to my initial wireframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also able to define the font used, as well as create buttons and ensure the images on the site are responsive (this was definitely a bigger challenge than I initially anticipated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adding HTML Pages to Python&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to take these pages and add them to the Flask framework using the render_template() function, this takes the name of the HTML file as an argument and allowed me to create an app route for each page. This not only ensured the pages could be rendered in the template, but also allowed for easy internal linking across the pages, rather than adding whole URL each time, I was able to just define the name of the page I wanted to link to, and it pulled the URL through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flask also allows you to add a template HTML file, where you can define a navigation and header structure to then use across the site. This meant that rather than have to replicate this on every page, I simply added a small function to add the block content from the template page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Code Editor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote all of the code in PyCharm as this is my code editor of choice to write HTML and CSS as well as Python. I also hooked up my Github account through the terminal which meant that I could easily commit the changes I made straight through PyCharm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Deploying and Hosting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is deployed through Github and Heroku which make it super easy to both store all of the code, pages and changes as well as commit the complete build to a fully working Heroku app. Heroku also makes it really simple to add a custom brought domain by configuring DNS with your purchased domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also upgrade your free account in order to configure an SSL certificate with end-to-end encryption through Heroku (there is also the option to manually add a certificate if you have purchased it elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Logo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend, and amazing designer, &lt;a href="https://www.lewisnelsondesign.com/contact"&gt;Lewis Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, went freelance last year and having worked with him previously I knew that he would be perfect to create the logo for SEO Dogs and it was. a great way to support his new business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what does SEO Dogs include?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics currently included on the SEO Dogs site are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Crawling and Indexing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Crawling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Rendering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Indexing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Robots.txt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Noindex &amp; Nofollow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Canonicals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Site Structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Site Architecture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Sitemaps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - URLs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - HTTPS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;On-page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Heading Tags&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Meta Data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Page Titles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Meta Descriptions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Alt Text&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;User Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Site Speed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Internal Links&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Backlinks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Redirects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;International SEO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Hreflang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - TLD &amp; ccTLD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any other topics you think would be useful to include, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't really thought that far ahead if I'm honest. I hope to continue working on my skills in order to continually improve the site, particularly focusing on user experience and ensuring it is as accessible and usable as possible. I'll also be updating the dogs on each page once they are adopted to their forever home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no question about how amazing and enriching owning a dog can be.¬† But it also a huge commitment and with the wonderful things, also comes the less pleasant factors which everyone should be aware of if they are thinking of getting a dog.&lt;/p&gt;¬†
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of dogs are handed into shelters every year, as many people are not aware of the less favourable sides to owning a dog.¬† Here is 9 reasons not to get a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. You like a lay in.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if your dog needs to pee, they need to pee, even if it's 5 in the morning or pouring with rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. You like going out, for hours on end.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs don't like being left alone for a long time, plus they, like humans, can only cross their legs for a certain amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. You're a clean freak. &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dog's are not clean, they are animals.¬† Just like children they have accidents, they love to chew and shed happens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. You like puppies.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people like cute puppies.¬† But few people like the adult, full grown dog they become.¬† Puppies don't stay cute, cuddly puppies forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. You're bored and think a dog could be fun.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then get a hobby, it's a lot easier to give up when you inevitably become bored.¬† Of course dogs are fun, but they are also living, breathing animals with daily needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. You're a commitmentphobe.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dog's are a daily, ongoing commitment.¬† They need daily walks, food, attention and love.¬† If this is something you can not guarantee you can give, don't get a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. You like going on holiday.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what's going to happen to your pup when you go away? Consider the care you want for your dog, and the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8. You're not ready for a huge responsibility.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a dog owner is a massive daily responsibility with walks, feeding, grooming, training and ultimately keeping your dog happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;9. Can you return the unconditional love you will receive?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs will provide you unconditional love, guaranteed. If you're not able to return that, then getting a dog isn't for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many dogs end up abandoned, and in shelters because their owners could not deal with them or they weren't what they expected. That is why it is so important to take the time to think about dog ownership before you welcome one into your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing a dog into your life is one of the most rewarding and fun choices you can make.¬† What's better thanks waking up to s smiling face, wagging tail and licks all over your face? Plus there are a lot of scientific proven benefits than owning a dog can bring into our lives.¬† If you're still undecided, here's 10 reasons why you should definitely get a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Dogs increase your mood&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a scientific fact that spending just 30 minutes playing with your pup can increase the serotonin levels in your brain helping you feel more relaxed, therefore increasing happiness and reducing stress. Dogs are also able to sense changes in our emotion and will do whatever they can to cheer you up, way before anyone else even realises you're upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Improve your health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dog owners are known to be more active than others, because of daily walks and adventures. Therefore dog owners have less risk of developing cardiovascular problems and have a higher rate of recovery in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. They're great for children too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs have proven that they can improve children's self-esteem, making stressful situations easier to handle and there's nothing cuter than seeing a child talking to their dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. They provide protection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even during puppyhood, dogs learn to watch and protect their owners. They become aware of anything which may put in at risk. Dogs are also very aware of any strange noises or people around your house and may even bark to warn you or scare them away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Improve your social interactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the things I have benefited from the most. I've always been a shy person and find it hard to deal with social situations. Dogs need socialising with other dogs as much as they do with humans, so it's your job to provide them with that. I took Ember to training classes which helped both her socialisation and my confidence, but if training classes isn't your thing, there's always puppy parties! (when it's safe of course)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. You'll never have a dull moment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll never find yourself at a loose end wondering what to do. There's always a park you walk, an adventure you can go on and or a toy to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. Don't worry about being lonely&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll never feel lonely when you have a four legged shadow following you around. You'll never pee alone plus your arrival will also be greeting with utter glee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8. Become a better person&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a dog comes with responsibility, commitment and patience, to name just a few. These are all good traits to have as a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;9. Laughter for days&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ember makes me laugh everyday, her funny little quirks and the silly things she does everyday will always cheer me up. Laughing is also scientifically proven to improve your health. Happy dog = happy human. Win win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;10. Your best, most loyal friend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most rewarding part of having a dog. A dog will love you forever, no matter what you do.¬† They will never judge you and spend most of their time trying to understand you, they probably know us better than we know ourselves. You'll never have a bond with a human like you will with your dog. All they want is make us happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a dog owner? What's the best thing to come out of owning a dog for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I &lt;a href="https://rvth.blog/article/python-and-google-trends.html"&gt;shared some of the things&lt;/a&gt; I had learned while playing around with the Google Trends Python library, PyTrends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I &lt;a href="https://rvth.blog/article/python-and-google-trends.html"&gt;shared some of the things&lt;/a&gt; I had learned while playing around with the Google Trends Python library, PyTrends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While collecting the data using this method is super fun and efficient, it's only really the start of what you can do with Python. Once we have the data saved in a Pandas DataFrame, our next step is to visualise the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this I wanted to share three different fun and fairly simple ways to visualise the data we have stored from Google Trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Let's start with Matplotlib&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Matplotlib?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matplotlib is a Python library for creating plotting visualisations. There are lots of different things you can create with Matplotlib, such as bar charts, line graphs, histograms and even heatmaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bar Charts with Matplotlib&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to try out Matplotlib with the Google Trends data, I took the rising related queries that I collected for the term BTS, and created two different bar charts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/bts-related-queries.webp" class="responsive" alt="related-queries-df" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first bar chart is a typical chart, with the queries along the x-axis and the values on the y-axis.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/matplotlib-bar-chart.webp" class="responsive" alt="matplotlib-bar-chart" width="700px" height="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this I used the rcParams in order to update the size and styling of the plot, as well as the font colour and size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/df3d67e998c2a7dc062abf576f286a05.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a similar command in order to create a horizontal bar chart, which features the query along the y-axis and the value along the x. In this example, the top rising keyword is at the bottom of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/matplotlib-horizontal-bar-chart.webp" class="responsive" alt="matplotlib-horizontal-bar-chart" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/f4645ae7a9572c428c436621c7cf5b53.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Next up is Seaborn&lt;h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Seaborn?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seaborn is another data visualisation library used in Python, and is actually based on Matplotlib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seaborn provides different visualisation patterns such as scatterplots, boxplots and violinplots, as well as line and bar graphs. It differs slightly from Matplotlib as it uses fewer syntax and has built in default themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Seaborn example, I took the interest over time data for the 5 dog breeds, and plotted a really simple line graph to show the spikes and dips in interest over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/seaborn-line-graph.webp" class="responsive" alt="seaborn-line-graph" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also played around with some of the styling options available in order to change the overall size of the chart using &lt;code&gt;figsize&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the font size. In addition, I used the style and palette functions in order to change the background grid to dark and the lines on the graph to be bright. This helped it to become slightly more visually appealing and easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/2ae6bad96bd47540d9d7c2dfce03ff9a.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Sheets and Google DataStudio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we can't forget the crown jewels of SEO data visualisation, Google Data Studio. We can use the Google Sheets integration to create dashboards for the data we have collected from Google Trends.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, we are going to take the data from our trending DataFrame in order to create a simple table in GDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we need to connect Google Colab to Google Sheets and create an empty spreadsheet to push our data to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/abc399001ca844458d31ea76cb4839f6.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/092adab4f83f30a3aefdee661aad3449.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We then need to take a custom formula, which is &lt;a href="https://www.danielecook.com/from-pandas-to-google-sheets/"&gt;written by Daniel Cook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/0e800baa730d7f394d8ec354b0f6b09c.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can use the pandas_to_sheets command to send the data from our already created DataFrame to our newly created spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/511a2cc1ce10f5bef5e2b1ce7ac4db55.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we have our data safely in the Google Sheets spreadsheet, we then need to create a new data connector for Google Data Studio, using the Google Sheets integration and select the relevant spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/google-sheets-gds-connector.webp" class="responsive" alt="google-sheets-gds-connector" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have this connector set up, we can then create a Data Studio report, using our Google Sheets data source, and choose the chart which best fits what we want to visualise. For our trending data, I have created a really simple table to display the trending search terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/trending-data-table.webp" class="responsive" alt="trending-data-table" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another visualisation we can create is using the related topics rising keywords and creating a horizontal bar chart to display the most popular keywords first. In order to create this we just need to follow the same steps as above, and change the chart type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/related-topic-graph.webp" class="responsive" alt="related-topic-graph" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/"&gt; Pytrends&lt;/a&gt; is the unofficial API for Google Trends that allows you to automate the process of downloading different reports from Google Trends and can be used within Python to collect data using the different methods available within the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/"&gt; Pytrends&lt;/a&gt; is the unofficial API for Google Trends that allows you to automate the process of downloading different reports from Google Trends and can be used within Python to collect data using the different methods available within the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Trends is a free resource created by Google that analyses and lists the trending search terms over a period of time, across different regions and timezones, along with suggestions for keywords and topics based on a given term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with this for a couple of weeks and wanted to share some of the interesting ways it can be used for SEO purposes. This first post will be an introduction to the API and the methods available, followed by the second part which will cover how to visualise the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting we need to install the required packages and libraries and connect to Google. I have also added some additional libraries to help store and visualise the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/f1c8e3c96cfe608c5e6c0f528b652311.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Build payload&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have all the necessary packages installed, we can start coding! Next we need build the payload which will allow us to enter parameters such as our keyword list, the timeframe to collect data, a region and timezone, as well as narrowing down further to a specific category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Parameters to add&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several parameters you can add to your payload, however the only required one is the keyword list where you can add the keywords you want to get data for. You can add up to 5 terms in a list, which is created like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/f161294747b184290cb989b887d210c2.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other parameters include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;timeframe&lt;/code&gt; - While this isn‚Äôt mandatory, as it will default to the last 5 years, you can set a timeframe you want to collect data from. You can do this in a couple of different ways:
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;With specific dates set in a YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD format. E.g. 2020-02-27 2020-03-27&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Current time minus the number of months using the format ‚Äòtoday #-m‚Äô where # is the number of months from the date you want to collect data from. E.g. ‚Äòtoday 2-m‚Äô will collect data from today to 2 months ago.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Current time minus the number of days using the format ‚Äònow #-d‚Äô where # is the number of days from the date you want to collect data from. E.g. ‚Äònow 7-d‚Äô to collect data from the last 7 days. Note this seems to only work for 1-7 days.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; - Allows you to use a category to narrow down results, this uses the integer for the category, which you can find &lt;a href="‚Äòhttps://github.com/pat310/google-trends-api/wiki/Google-Trends-Categories‚Äô"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;. This isn‚Äôt compulsory, as it will default to no category.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;code&gt;geo&lt;/code&gt; - Allows you to narrow down to a specific country, using the two letter country abbreviation, eg ‚ÄòGB‚Äô. Again this isn‚Äôt compulsory, as it will default to ‚ÄòWorld‚Äô.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gprop&lt;/code&gt; - The Google property you want to filter to (images, news, YouTube, Google Shopping). This will default to web search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So say for example I want to collect data over the last year for the popularity of searches for my 3 favourite k-pop groups, using the music category (35), in the US, I would build my payload as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/cec23cdaffb19ebde7b3fd8da65e66c7.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;API Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the fun bit, collecting different types of data. There are several API methods you can use with the Pytrends library, which you can find more about &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/#api-methods"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; but I‚Äôm just going to share a few which may be most useful for SEO use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Interest over time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will return historical data for when a keyword was searched for the most, over the timeframe you select. This is reflective of what is shown in the 'interest over time' section of Google Trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example I have created a keyword list of five dog breeds to see how the search volume for these terms has changed over the last 3 months. I also turned the results given into a Pandas DataFrame in order to analyse the data easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/403eca7121f5bbe68cf5571c74509c10.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will generate a DataFrame with a column for each date, and each search term in my keyword list, with the search volume for each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/interest-overtime.webp" class="lazyload" alt="interest-over-time-df" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Interest by region&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this method we will be able to see data for where a keyword is most searched for. There are a couple of different parameters you can add to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;resolution&lt;/code&gt; - Can be set to CITY, COUNTRY or REGION.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;code&gt;inc_low_vol&lt;/code&gt; - Either a True or False boolean to determine whether to display data for low volume countries.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;inc_geo_code&lt;/code&gt; - This can also be set to either True or False, depending on whether you want to include ISO codes along with the country names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two examples of this method, the first with no parameters, which displays all countries and the interest of the search term across these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/a1fd807377ae3c5b024d5df8d7bb089c.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other displays region level data for the country Geo code 'GB'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/223ed65d7b33ce3185d2e7599b8c5641.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Related queries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will return data for keywords related to the provided keyword, and the output is displayed in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Top: Which displays a Google Trends score between 0-100.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Rising: Displays how much interest the keyword has increased by in a %.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, my keyword list contains 5 endangered animals from the WWF site, where I collect the values for all of the terms. I will then use the &lt;code&gt;.get&lt;/code&gt; method to display the rising and top values for a selected keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/e425f04aa3c395ffe144bb87d223ec46.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/related-queries-rising.webp" class="lazyload" alt="related-queries-rising-df" width="400px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestions method will display a list of additional suggested keywords that can also be used for a trend search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my example I have defined a keyword within the method and displayed the results as a dataframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/2e75a6308cc86deaa4b7762c2885bf37.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/suggestions.webp" class="lazyload" alt="suggestions-df" width="500px" &amp;lt; div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Trending searches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final method I want to share is the trending searches. This will return data for the latest trending searches, either worldwide or for the country you include within the method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/90d98d4cc5847d3a90ac5d002be1bfec.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also shared an example of a Google Data Studio dashboard I have created using the trending searches method for both the UK and US, which can be updated daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just because I&amp;#39;m a bit of a nerd and wanted to try out the Google Trends API in Python I now have a dashboard displaying the top 20 trending searches in the UK and US every day. It literally serves no purpose except for some occasional lols ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è &lt;a href="https://t.co/CUB0d8xgsG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CUB0d8xgsG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ruth‚Å∑ (@rvtheverett) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rvtheverett/status/1285305449819111425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this has provided a good introduction to the Pytrends API and how it can be used in Python to find some interesting data for different search terms. The most powerful part of this though is the visulisations we can create from the data. The concluding part of this post will share how I use the Python libraries MatPlotLib and Seaborn to create visulations, as well as how to connect the data to Google Sheets in order to display results within a Google DataStudio dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find a Google Colab notebook &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10t-AbNxx1G8kaHSjrkyXlfs2Yl-NSuiq?usp=sharing"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;, with the examples shared above if you would like to save and use as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhy did you start learning to code?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question makes me panic a bit, because to be honest, I don‚Äôt really think I have a sufficient answer. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I just wanted to learn something new‚Äù is what I would typically answer. But looking back coding has ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhy did you start learning to code?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question makes me panic a bit, because to be honest, I don‚Äôt really think I have a sufficient answer. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I just wanted to learn something new‚Äù is what I would typically answer. But looking back coding has always been something that has interested me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up spending a lot of time on computers and I vividly remember the opening of my primary school‚Äôs computer room when I was about 9. I was also pretty bad at socialising and have always been awkward around people, so I instead choose to spend time reading or playing on a computer rather than talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also a Tumblr kid and would spend hours tweaking themes as I was a little too obsessed with the aesthetics, I mean who didn‚Äôt want a sparkly cursor and snow in the background. I didn‚Äôt realise it at the time but I spent many hours Googling HTML and CSS, without even realising what it was. I also didn‚Äôt know at the time that people did this as a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I realised view source code and inspect element were a thing, but once I had discovered them I viewed them on every site I went on (just for fun more than anything).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought exploring some of the things which have inspired me to learn might be a good topic to talk about here. So here goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My Dad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad is an engineer and, due to illness, he has worked from home pretty much my entire life. I used to watch his two screens with fascination and loved it when he tried to explain to me what he was working on, even though I had no idea what he was talking about. I never understood any of it, and was insistent I would never, in a million years, be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is currently working a lot with machine learning and I love that I am now able to understand what he is showing me, and even sometimes get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my dog came into my life I decided to make a blog about being a first time dog owner (as you do when you‚Äôre a crazy dog person). I created a WordPress account, brought a domain and started hosting my blog with Green Hosting (they are 100% wind powered, because #ecowarrior). Again I played around with the HTML of the themes and posts and loved discovering how to make things look perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wanting More From Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided early on that university wasn‚Äôt for me and started working full time when I was 17. My first job was a mundane admin role and I just kept thinking, there must be more to life than this. Then, while completing a marketing module with the open university I discovered that digital marketing, and more specifically SEO, was a thing. I worked hard on my blog and studying, as well as volunteering for an animal charity, and managed to land at great job at a local agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interest in the technical side of SEO piqued pretty early on and to say I became obsessed with it would probably be an understatement. I read everything I could find on the topic and enjoyed the challenges of every project I worked on. I loved working with the developers and told them about my desire to learn to code and they were nothing but encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;To Help My Career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since working in technical SEO the need to have programming knowledge has never been more apparent. I want to be able to comfortably communicate with developers and engineers that I work with, to have confidence in the conversations I am having with them and for them to have confidence in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also enables me to keep on top of the trends and technology advancements happening in the industry all the time and share these with other people to inspire them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also become something I can talk about for hours, which is a big feat considering I usually struggle to hold a conversation for more than 10 minutes. I have even started to speak at local events about how Python can help with technical SEO and written about it for a top SEO publication!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;For My Mental Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding is incredibly therapeutic to me, being able to concrete on learning and practicing different things enables me to stop thinking about other thoughts that are constantly running through my head. Then after awhile things begin to feel less daunting and I feel my mental health has started to improve. Being able to work out complex problems and debug errors also helps with my confidence and self belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's everything from me, I'd love to hear what inspired you :)&lt;/p&gt;
