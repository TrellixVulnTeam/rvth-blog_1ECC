&lt;p&gt;I love Pandas (the Python library and the animal) it makes working with large data sets so much easier and allows for a high level of data exploration, transformation and visualisation. It‚Äôs probably one of the libraries I would recommend learning the most, especially for everyone working in SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to get started with your first Python project but don‚Äôt know where to start or stuck for ideas? This mega post includes project ideas for everything you can think of from fun games such as rock, paper, scissors and pac-man, to recommendation applications and prediction tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;üå± Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-beginner-tips/"&gt;11 Beginner Tips for Learning Python Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning something new is HARD, learning something new when the world is imploding is even harder. It can be daunting to know where to start, and if you‚Äôre anything like me you become an expert procrastinator even though you‚Äôre so keen to learn. I found this article super helpful when I first started learning Python. It starts with the most important step - learning how you learn, everyone is different and what works for some people won‚Äôt work for others. The post then goes on to share tips for starting, and most importantly, continuing to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;üíô For good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/"&gt;Alt text as poetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one isn‚Äôt Python related, but still super relevant for us as SEOs. Alt text is often an overlooked and misunderstood element of our job, and putting aside image search for now, it is an essential part of web accessibility. This project, started by two artists and activists, encourages us to rethink how we view alt text in order to approach it more thoughtfully and creatively to ultimately create a more inclusive web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;‚ú® More cool-ness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently started reading Algorithms of Oppression by Safiya Noble which is described as ‚ÄòA revealing look at how negative biases against women of color are embedded in search engine results and algorithms‚Äô. As someone obsessed with the tech world, working in SEO, and also really passionate about D&amp;I;, I already feel like this is going to be a super important and eye opening read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhy did you start learning to code?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question makes me panic a bit, because to be honest, I don‚Äôt really think I have a sufficient answer. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I just wanted to learn something new‚Äù is what I would typically answer. But looking back coding has always been something that has interested me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up spending a lot of time on computers and I vividly remember the opening of my primary school‚Äôs computer room when I was about 9. I was also pretty bad at socialising and have always been awkward around people, so I instead choose to spend time reading or playing on a computer rather than talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also a Tumblr kid and would spend hours tweaking themes as I was a little too obsessed with the aesthetics, I mean who didn‚Äôt want a sparkly cursor and snow in the background. I didn‚Äôt realise it at the time but I spent many hours Googling HTML and CSS, without even realising what it was. I also didn‚Äôt know at the time that people did this as a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I realised view source code and inspect element were a thing, but once I had discovered them I viewed them on every site I went on (just for fun more than anything).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought exploring some of the things which have inspired me to learn might be a good topic to talk about here. So here goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My Dad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad is an engineer and, due to illness, he has worked from home pretty much my entire life. I used to watch his two screens with fascination and loved it when he tried to explain to me what he was working on, even though I had no idea what he was talking about. I never understood any of it, and was insistent I would never, in a million years, be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is currently working a lot with machine learning and I love that I am now able to understand what he is showing me, and even sometimes get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my dog came into my life I decided to make a blog about being a first time dog owner (as you do when you‚Äôre a crazy dog person). I created a WordPress account, brought a domain and started hosting my blog with Green Hosting (they are 100% wind powered, because #ecowarrior). Again I played around with the HTML of the themes and posts and loved discovering how to make things look perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wanting More From Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided early on that university wasn‚Äôt for me and started working full time when I was 17. My first job was a mundane admin role and I just kept thinking, there must be more to life than this. Then, while completing a marketing module with the open university I discovered that digital marketing, and more specifically SEO, was a thing. I worked hard on my blog and studying, as well as volunteering for an animal charity, and managed to land at great job at a local agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interest in the technical side of SEO piqued pretty early on and to say I became obsessed with it would probably be an understatement. I read everything I could find on the topic and enjoyed the challenges of every project I worked on. I loved working with the developers and told them about my desire to learn to code and they were nothing but encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;To Help My Career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since working in technical SEO the need to have programming knowledge has never been more apparent. I want to be able to comfortably communicate with developers and engineers that I work with, to have confidence in the conversations I am having with them and for them to have confidence in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also enables me to keep on top of the trends and technology advancements happening in the industry all the time and share these with other people to inspire them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also become something I can talk about for hours, which is a big feat considering I usually struggle to hold a conversation for more than 10 minutes. I have even started to speak at local events about how Python can help with technical SEO and written about it for a top SEO publication!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;For My Mental Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding is incredibly therapeutic to me, being able to concrete on learning and practicing different things enables me to stop thinking about other thoughts that are constantly running through my head. Then after awhile things begin to feel less daunting and I feel my mental health has started to improve. Being able to work out complex problems and debug errors also helps with my confidence and self belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's everything from me, I'd love to hear what inspired you :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I &lt;a href="https://rvth.blog/article/python-and-google-trends.html"&gt;shared some of the things&lt;/a&gt; I had learned while playing around with the Google Trends Python library, PyTrends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I &lt;a href="https://rvth.blog/article/python-and-google-trends.html"&gt;shared some of the things&lt;/a&gt; I had learned while playing around with the Google Trends Python library, PyTrends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While collecting the data using this method is super fun and efficient, it's only really the start of what you can do with Python. Once we have the data saved in a Pandas DataFrame, our next step is to visualise the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this I wanted to share three different fun and fairly simple ways to visualise the data we have stored from Google Trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Let's start with Matplotlib&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Matplotlib?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matplotlib is a Python library for creating plotting visualisations. There are lots of different things you can create with Matplotlib, such as bar charts, line graphs, histograms and even heatmaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bar Charts with Matplotlib&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to try out Matplotlib with the Google Trends data, I took the rising related queries that I collected for the term BTS, and created two different bar charts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/bts-related-queries.webp" class="responsive" alt="related-queries-df" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first bar chart is a typical chart, with the queries along the x-axis and the values on the y-axis.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/matplotlib-bar-chart.webp" class="responsive" alt="matplotlib-bar-chart" width="700px" height="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this I used the rcParams in order to update the size and styling of the plot, as well as the font colour and size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/df3d67e998c2a7dc062abf576f286a05.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a similar command in order to create a horizontal bar chart, which features the query along the y-axis and the value along the x. In this example, the top rising keyword is at the bottom of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/matplotlib-horizontal-bar-chart.webp" class="responsive" alt="matplotlib-horizontal-bar-chart" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/f4645ae7a9572c428c436621c7cf5b53.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Next up is Seaborn&lt;h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Seaborn?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seaborn is another data visualisation library used in Python, and is actually based on Matplotlib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seaborn provides different visualisation patterns such as scatterplots, boxplots and violinplots, as well as line and bar graphs. It differs slightly from Matplotlib as it uses fewer syntax and has built in default themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Seaborn example, I took the interest over time data for the 5 dog breeds, and plotted a really simple line graph to show the spikes and dips in interest over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/seaborn-line-graph.webp" class="responsive" alt="seaborn-line-graph" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also played around with some of the styling options available in order to change the overall size of the chart using &lt;code&gt;figsize&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the font size. In addition, I used the style and palette functions in order to change the background grid to dark and the lines on the graph to be bright. This helped it to become slightly more visually appealing and easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/2ae6bad96bd47540d9d7c2dfce03ff9a.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Sheets and Google DataStudio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we can't forget the crown jewels of SEO data visualisation, Google Data Studio. We can use the Google Sheets integration to create dashboards for the data we have collected from Google Trends.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, we are going to take the data from our trending DataFrame in order to create a simple table in GDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we need to connect Google Colab to Google Sheets and create an empty spreadsheet to push our data to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/abc399001ca844458d31ea76cb4839f6.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/092adab4f83f30a3aefdee661aad3449.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We then need to take a custom formula, which is &lt;a href="https://www.danielecook.com/from-pandas-to-google-sheets/"&gt;written by Daniel Cook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/0e800baa730d7f394d8ec354b0f6b09c.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can use the pandas_to_sheets command to send the data from our already created DataFrame to our newly created spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/511a2cc1ce10f5bef5e2b1ce7ac4db55.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we have our data safely in the Google Sheets spreadsheet, we then need to create a new data connector for Google Data Studio, using the Google Sheets integration and select the relevant spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/google-sheets-gds-connector.webp" class="responsive" alt="google-sheets-gds-connector" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have this connector set up, we can then create a Data Studio report, using our Google Sheets data source, and choose the chart which best fits what we want to visualise. For our trending data, I have created a really simple table to display the trending search terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/trending-data-table.webp" class="responsive" alt="trending-data-table" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another visualisation we can create is using the related topics rising keywords and creating a horizontal bar chart to display the most popular keywords first. In order to create this we just need to follow the same steps as above, and change the chart type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/related-topic-graph.webp" class="responsive" alt="related-topic-graph" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/"&gt; Pytrends&lt;/a&gt; is the unofficial API for Google Trends that allows you to automate the process of downloading different reports from Google Trends and can be used within Python to collect data using the different methods available within the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/"&gt; Pytrends&lt;/a&gt; is the unofficial API for Google Trends that allows you to automate the process of downloading different reports from Google Trends and can be used within Python to collect data using the different methods available within the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Trends is a free resource created by Google that analyses and lists the trending search terms over a period of time, across different regions and timezones, along with suggestions for keywords and topics based on a given term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with this for a couple of weeks and wanted to share some of the interesting ways it can be used for SEO purposes. This first post will be an introduction to the API and the methods available, followed by the second part which will cover how to visualise the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting we need to install the required packages and libraries and connect to Google. I have also added some additional libraries to help store and visualise the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/f1c8e3c96cfe608c5e6c0f528b652311.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Build payload&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have all the necessary packages installed, we can start coding! Next we need build the payload which will allow us to enter parameters such as our keyword list, the timeframe to collect data, a region and timezone, as well as narrowing down further to a specific category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Parameters to add&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several parameters you can add to your payload, however the only required one is the keyword list where you can add the keywords you want to get data for. You can add up to 5 terms in a list, which is created like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/f161294747b184290cb989b887d210c2.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other parameters include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;timeframe&lt;/code&gt; - While this isn‚Äôt mandatory, as it will default to the last 5 years, you can set a timeframe you want to collect data from. You can do this in a couple of different ways:
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;With specific dates set in a YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD format. E.g. 2020-02-27 2020-03-27&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Current time minus the number of months using the format ‚Äòtoday #-m‚Äô where # is the number of months from the date you want to collect data from. E.g. ‚Äòtoday 2-m‚Äô will collect data from today to 2 months ago.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Current time minus the number of days using the format ‚Äònow #-d‚Äô where # is the number of days from the date you want to collect data from. E.g. ‚Äònow 7-d‚Äô to collect data from the last 7 days. Note this seems to only work for 1-7 days.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; - Allows you to use a category to narrow down results, this uses the integer for the category, which you can find &lt;a href="‚Äòhttps://github.com/pat310/google-trends-api/wiki/Google-Trends-Categories‚Äô"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;. This isn‚Äôt compulsory, as it will default to no category.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;code&gt;geo&lt;/code&gt; - Allows you to narrow down to a specific country, using the two letter country abbreviation, eg ‚ÄòGB‚Äô. Again this isn‚Äôt compulsory, as it will default to ‚ÄòWorld‚Äô.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gprop&lt;/code&gt; - The Google property you want to filter to (images, news, YouTube, Google Shopping). This will default to web search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So say for example I want to collect data over the last year for the popularity of searches for my 3 favourite k-pop groups, using the music category (35), in the US, I would build my payload as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/cec23cdaffb19ebde7b3fd8da65e66c7.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;API Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the fun bit, collecting different types of data. There are several API methods you can use with the Pytrends library, which you can find more about &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/#api-methods"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; but I‚Äôm just going to share a few which may be most useful for SEO use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Interest over time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will return historical data for when a keyword was searched for the most, over the timeframe you select. This is reflective of what is shown in the 'interest over time' section of Google Trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example I have created a keyword list of five dog breeds to see how the search volume for these terms has changed over the last 3 months. I also turned the results given into a Pandas DataFrame in order to analyse the data easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/403eca7121f5bbe68cf5571c74509c10.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will generate a DataFrame with a column for each date, and each search term in my keyword list, with the search volume for each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/interest-overtime.webp" class="lazyload" alt="interest-over-time-df" width="700px" &amp;lt; div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Interest by region&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this method we will be able to see data for where a keyword is most searched for. There are a couple of different parameters you can add to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;resolution&lt;/code&gt; - Can be set to CITY, COUNTRY or REGION.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;code&gt;inc_low_vol&lt;/code&gt; - Either a True or False boolean to determine whether to display data for low volume countries.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;inc_geo_code&lt;/code&gt; - This can also be set to either True or False, depending on whether you want to include ISO codes along with the country names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two examples of this method, the first with no parameters, which displays all countries and the interest of the search term across these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/a1fd807377ae3c5b024d5df8d7bb089c.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other displays region level data for the country Geo code 'GB'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/223ed65d7b33ce3185d2e7599b8c5641.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Related queries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will return data for keywords related to the provided keyword, and the output is displayed in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Top: Which displays a Google Trends score between 0-100.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Rising: Displays how much interest the keyword has increased by in a %.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, my keyword list contains 5 endangered animals from the WWF site, where I collect the values for all of the terms. I will then use the &lt;code&gt;.get&lt;/code&gt; method to display the rising and top values for a selected keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/e425f04aa3c395ffe144bb87d223ec46.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/related-queries-rising.webp" class="lazyload" alt="related-queries-rising-df" width="400px" &amp;lt; div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestions method will display a list of additional suggested keywords that can also be used for a trend search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my example I have defined a keyword within the method and displayed the results as a dataframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/2e75a6308cc86deaa4b7762c2885bf37.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/suggestions.webp" class="lazyload" alt="suggestions-df" width="500px" &amp;lt; div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Trending searches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final method I want to share is the trending searches. This will return data for the latest trending searches, either worldwide or for the country you include within the method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/rvth/90d98d4cc5847d3a90ac5d002be1bfec.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also shared an example of a Google Data Studio dashboard I have created using the trending searches method for both the UK and US, which can be updated daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just because I&amp;#39;m a bit of a nerd and wanted to try out the Google Trends API in Python I now have a dashboard displaying the top 20 trending searches in the UK and US every day. It literally serves no purpose except for some occasional lols ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è &lt;a href="https://t.co/CUB0d8xgsG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CUB0d8xgsG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ruth‚Å∑ (@rvtheverett) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rvtheverett/status/1285305449819111425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this has provided a good introduction to the Pytrends API and how it can be used in Python to find some interesting data for different search terms. The most powerful part of this though is the visulisations we can create from the data. The concluding part of this post will share how I use the Python libraries MatPlotLib and Seaborn to create visulations, as well as how to connect the data to Google Sheets in order to display results within a Google DataStudio dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find a Google Colab notebook &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10t-AbNxx1G8kaHSjrkyXlfs2Yl-NSuiq?usp=sharing"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;, with the examples shared above if you would like to save and use as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/hello-world.jxr" class="lazyload" alt="hello world" &amp;lt; div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been sat staring at this blank document for the last 2 hours trying to figure what to write, my first blog post for a blog I never thought I would actually create. I guess I just wanted to introduce myself and the aim of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">
    &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/hello-world.jxr" class="lazyload" alt="hello world" &amp;lt; div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been sat staring at this blank document for the last 2 hours trying to figure what to write, my first blog post for a blog I never thought I would actually create. I guess I just wanted to introduce myself and the aim of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started my first blog 4 years ago when I got my dog Ember, it was a ‚Äòlifestyle blog‚Äô focused on dog ownership and while I enjoyed writing it and it a great learning journey (and Ember enjoyed the free treats we received) the content I was putting out wasn‚Äôt great and I felt pressured to post every single week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never intended to create another blog, for many reasons; my perfectionism, imposter syndrome and the fear no one would actually read it. But a couple of weeks ago, one of the most inspirational people I have ever met, Areej Abuali, created her blog and wrote &lt;a href="https://www.areejabuali.com/blog/hello-seo-world"&gt; this post&lt;/a&gt;, which gave me the kick up the butt I needed to finally finish creating this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than use WordPress to build it, I decided to put the skills I have been learning over the last year into practice and build it using a static site generator called Pelican, which is powered by Python. I also found a theme which is easily customisable using HTML and CSS and use GitHub and Netifly to host and deploy it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Getting started in SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite working in digital marketing for the last 3 years, I‚Äôve never actually been a massive fan of traditional marketing, or thought I was very good at it. I'm certainly not very good at marketing myself. To be honest I've never really interested in advertising, marketing strategies or customer personas, preferring instead to investigate problems and find solutions, which is why I think I gravitated towards and ultimately decided to specialise in SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A popular question in the SEO space is ‚Äòhow did you get started in SEO?‚Äô I feel like the answer is pretty similar for most people; ‚ÄòI just kind of fell into it‚Äô, and that‚Äôs certainly how it started for me. 5 years ago I didn‚Äôt even know SEO was a thing, it‚Äôs certainly not something that is taught in school or something that you can talk to your career advisor about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After working in email marketing for almost a year, I was more than ready for a change and had the chance to join a digital agency and dive head first into a big SEO project for a company with several different country based sites. This opened my eyes to many aspects of SEO and I quickly became obsessed with it. I spent countless hours reading articles and whitepapers, watching webinars and listening to podcasts on all things SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year ago I somehow managed to get a job at an SEO software company where I‚Äôm super lucky to get to work with some of the smartest SEOs (and kindest people I know). I‚Äôve also had the opportunity to speak at events, write for industry publications, meet so many inspirational people and was shortlisted for Young Search Professional of the Year at the 2019 UK Search Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people would say I‚Äôm a bad SEO because I don‚Äôt really care for being controlled by a corporate giant like Google, I don‚Äôt panic over algorithm updates or feel the need to always be chasing rankings. I care about user experience, making sure a website is accessible and enjoyable for users.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Starting to learn to code&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess I‚Äôve always been interested in coding without even realising what it was, ever since my Tumblr days when I would spend hours tweaking themes to make a sparkly cursor and have snow falling in the background. I didn‚Äôt realise it at the time but I spent many hours Googling HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be honest and say that I was put off the idea of working in a technical field because it never seemed like there were many people like me working in it. But that‚Äôs changing now and I‚Äôm so excited and inspired by all the female developers and engineers showing women of all ages that there is a place for them in tech. I hope that one day I can become someone who helps to inspire people to start a career in STEM.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;My aim with this blog&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be honest I don‚Äôt really know what my intention with creating this blog really is. I guess I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do this, and hopefully inspire someone else to get started with that thing they have been putting off. I hope to use this small space to document my learning journey, speak about topics I‚Äôm passionate about and share my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Growth is hard and putting yourself out there is daunting and terrifying. The pressure to be perfect can prevent us from doing something we‚Äôve always wanted to do. I just want this blog to be authentic and honest and therefore it‚Äôs going to be far from perfect, but I don‚Äôt want to pressure myself to make it so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading my first blog post/ramble, I‚Äôm super excited to share more &amp;#128156; And that thing you've always wanted to create, here's your push to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
