<p>Hi, I'm Ruth. I like dogs, conspiracy theories and this &#129402; emoji. Iâ€™m also perpetually bad at talking about myself so I'll keep this short.
I've always been pretty obsessed with the digital world and pretty much grew up around computers. I'm also pretty <br />
    bad at socalising and have always been awkward around people, so I always chose to spend time reading or playing on a computer over talking.</p>
               <br>
                <p>After working towards a career in digital marketing I found a passion for SEO and now work in technical SEO. I'm passionate about user experience, performance and accessiblity and feel so fortunate that I'm able to do Despite not having a CS background, I've always wanted to learn to code, <br />
                    so over the last couple of years I've been learning (and making many mistakes) in my free time.</p>
