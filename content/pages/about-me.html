<p>Hi, I'm Ruth &#128060; I like dogs, conspiracy theories and this &#129402; emoji. Iâ€™m also perpetually bad at talking about myself so I'll keep this <br/>short.
I've always been obsessed with the digital world and pretty much grew up around computers. I'm also quite bad at socalising and have always been awkward around people, so I usually choose to spend time reading or playing on a computer over talking.</p>
                <p>After working towards a career in digital marketing I found a passion for SEO and I'm now so fortunate to work in technical SEO. I'm passionate about user experience, performance and accessiblity, with a keen interest in automation and machine learning. Despite <br /> not having a CS background,
                    I've spent the last year learning to code (and making many mistakes) in my free time, which led me to creating this blog.</p>
                <p>In my spare time you'll probably find me reading, watching videos of dogs, doing yoga workouts, listening to BTS or binging a Netflix series. I'm also passionate about fighting social justice issues, female empowerment and animal welfare.</p>
