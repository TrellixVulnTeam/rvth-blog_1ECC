<p>Hi, I'm Ruth &#128060; I like dogs, conspiracy theories and this &#129402; emoji. Iâ€™m also perpetually bad at talking about myself so I'll keep this short.
I've always been obsessed with the digital world and pretty much grew up around computers. I'm also pretty bad at socalising and have always been awkward around people, so I usually choose to spend time reading or playing on a computer over talking.</p>
                <p>After working towards a career in digital marketing I found a passion for SEO and now work in technical SEO. I'm passionate about user experience, performance and accessiblity and feel so fortunate that I'm able to do this as a job. Despite not having a CS background,
                    I've spent the last year learning to code (and making many mistakes) in my free time, which <br /> led me to creating this blog.</p>
                 <div class="image"><img src="/images/ruth-and-ember.jpg" class="profile-img" alt="Profile Photo" style="width:350px;height:350px;"></div>
                <p>In my spare time you'll probably find me reading, watching videos of dogs, doing yoga, listening to BTS or binging a Netflix series.</p>
