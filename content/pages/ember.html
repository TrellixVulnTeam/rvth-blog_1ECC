<p>It wouldn't be right if I didn't make a page for my beloved dog, Ember. She quite literally is the light of my life and gives me a reason to get up in the morning.</p>

<p>She also likes to get involved with projects I'm working on, and I often call her my coding partner in crime.</p>

<p>A typical labrador, she loves food, any kind of food will do really. But her favourite things to eat are bananas, strawberries, biscuits, blackberries, sasusages and the odd stone on a walk.</p>
