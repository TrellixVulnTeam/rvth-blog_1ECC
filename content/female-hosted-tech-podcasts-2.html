<p>I'm a massive fan of podcasts and have been listening to them for several years. As my interests change so do the podcasts I listen to, and for the past couple of years my podcast library has been full of both tech focused and true crime podcasts.</p>
<p>I wanted to share some of my favourite inspirational, female hosted tech podcasts which I have been listening to and learnt a lot from.</p>
